MSWL Django Exercise

Places Project: A list of cool places like bars, restaurants, etc.

A Place has:
- - name
- - description
- - URL
- - creation date
- - number of views

The project should allow to:
- - list the places by: 1) descending date; 2) number of views
- - view a place (viewing a place increments its number of views)

Places should be added/edited through Django's automatic admin.

Extra points: Present a form to upload places (outside of Django's admin).
